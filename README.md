[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-flutter_version_manager)

## About this fork
The original version probably doesn't support $ (MARKETING_VERSION) variable and flavors. After a few changes, it started working;)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-flutter_version_manager`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin flutter_version_manager
```

Inside project root, create new `version.yml` file and add the following:
```
---
major: 0
minor: 0
patch: 1

```

This plugin heavily resides on having a git repository. You need to configure [ruby-git](https://github.com/ruby-git/ruby-git). Add ```gem 'git'``` to `fastlane/Pluginfile` or follow the instructions from their repository.

## About flutter_version_manager

Manages app versioning of a Flutter project. This plugin heavily resides on having a git repository and at least one commit as version code is applied through timestamp of HEAD commit. As for app version, `version.yml` should be used as a single source of truth. In order to apply changes to pubspec, use `-apply` as an argument of a plugin.

This plugin accepts 4 arguments:
- `yml` - Path to version.yml file
- `pubspec` - Path to pubspec.yaml file
- `git_repo` - Path to git repository (optional)
- `arguments` - Additional arguments as stated below (optional)
```
-h: Access this menu
-version: Reads current version name
-code: Reads current version code
-major: Bumps major version
-minor: Bumps minor version
-patch: Bumps patch version
-apply: Applies version specified from version.yml to pubspec
```
